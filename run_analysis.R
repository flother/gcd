# Take the data provided in Reyes-Ortiz et al's smartphone-based human activity
# recognition dataset and merge the training and test sets, extract only mean
# and standard deviation measurements, add subject and activity columns, and
# tidy the data so it has one value per column and one observation per line.
#
# Note: this script assumes you have a copy of the dataset in your working
# directory. To get it, download and unzip the data from:

#     https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata/projectfiles/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
#
# Make the resulting "UCI HAR Dataset" directory your working directory.
